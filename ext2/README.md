# ext2
This is our ext2 implementation.
It will be generic. iposix will not be a necessary to use this library. Therefore the code is not in the iposix directory.


## testing

During development, we will build userland programs on the host system to increase development speed and make use of the ext2 implementation of our host systems to verify our code(e.g. create a file with our implementation and read that file with the host system).
